## For all Harry Potter fans, as part of my 52 weeks of go-lang, for this project I am going to build an application that will allow users to search for spells that were used in the Harry Potter world. 

## To do 

- [x] Create an online postgreSQL database via amazon web services
- [ ] Build a web scraping application to gather all the spells via http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_spells?action=edit
- [ ] Push data to the database
- [ ] Optimise the database structure 
- [ ] Decide on which section to place more weights
- [x] Set up host
- [X] Set up heroku for deployment
